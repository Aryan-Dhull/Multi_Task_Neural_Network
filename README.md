# Multi_Task_Neural_Network

Implemented a multi-task neural network from scratch (including back-propagation) having the following attributes:
      (i) 2 inputs (both continuous).
      (ii) 2 hidden layers (one has sigmoid, and another has tanh as the activation function).
      (iii) 2 outputs (one for binary classification and another for regression).

      
Used stochastic gradient descent approach and had 80:20 split for training and validation.
Did weighted addition of losses.
